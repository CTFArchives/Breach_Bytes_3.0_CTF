Description:
Manya is a mid‑level developer at a small privacy startup. Late one evening she noticed odd behaviour on her workstation: a local archive she trusted became inaccessible and a private sync service that she uses suddenly had a saved credential she didn’t remember creating. You were called in as the incident responder.
