Description:
Years ago, humanity sent a simple radio signal into deep space as part of a global initiative to reach extraterrestrial life.
For decades, we received nothing… until now.

Two faint recordings were captured in return — Transmission1.wav and Transmission2.wav. Can you decode it?

**These are two waves of the same transmission , one over others gives the comlpete one**
