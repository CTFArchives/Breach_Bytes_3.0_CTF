Description:
Welcome to Homicide. Your initial task is to sift through the infamous "No-Leads" shelf. You pull a file—Case 77-09—an old, high-profile murder that baffled everyone. The case is practically empty; no witnesses, no motive,just one item: a concise Forensic Report (maybe more than just one file?) of the victim.

Information Leaked : She used a niche social media site, Tumble? Tumbler ? What was it called?

Your mission: Find the name of the killer and where the evidence was disposed of. (Flag format = DJSISACA{KillerName_PlaceName}) (all lowercase)
