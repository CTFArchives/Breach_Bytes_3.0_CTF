Description:
You found this photo hidden deep within a box of my friend’s old things. When I asked about it, he clamped up, his face draining of color. All that remains is the unsettling inscription: 'Something bad happened here.' What secret is this image hiding, and why is my friend so afraid of it?

Find the date the tragedy struck the location. (Flag Format : DJSISACA{DD_MM_YYYY})
